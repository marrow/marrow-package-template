Please describe the package here in few sentences; the goal is about a paragraph. Something easy to digest, but not too brief to give a good idea of what the package is for. For example, this is not a real package, it's a package template for "unpacking" on GitHub using their Repository Templates feature. You won't find this on the Python Package Index (Pypi).

## Overview

Provide a more detailed or in-depth description here, being sure to cover both rationale and goals.


## Installation

Installing `$project` is easy, just execute the following in a terminal:

	pip install $project

**Note:** We *strongly* recommend always using a container, virtualization, or sandboxing environment of some kind when developing using Python. We highly recommend use of the Python standard [`venv` (_"virtual environment"_) mechanism][venv].

If you add `$project` to the `install_requires` argument of the call to `setup()` in your application's `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` files, $project will be automatically installed and made available when your own application or library is installed. Use `$project ~= $version` to get all bug fixes for the current release while ensuring that large breaking changes are not installed by limiting to the same major/minor, >= the given patch level.

This package has the following dependencies:

* A Python interpreter compatible with CPython 3.7 and or newer, i.e. official CPython or Pypy.


### Development Version

> [![][developstatus]][developstatus_] [![][developcover]][developcover_] [![][ghsince]][ghsince_] [![][ghissues]][ghissues_] [![][ghfork]][ghfork_]

Development takes place on [GitHub][github] in the [$repo][repo] project. Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version requires [Git][git]), a distributed source code management system. If you have Git you can run the following to download and *link* the development version into your Python runtime:

	git clone https://github.com/marrow/$repo.git
	pip install -e '$repo[development]'

You can then upgrade to the latest version at any time, from within that source folder:

	git pull
	pip install -e '.[development]'

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request. This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information see [GitHub's documentation][ghhelp].


## Getting Started

Describe the basic steps required to utilize this package. Provide additional sections or subsections as needed. If this documentation exceeds an additional section or two, consider writing a GitBook instead.


## Version History

This project has yet to make any releases. When it does, each release should be documented here with a sub-section for the version, and a bulleted list of itemized changes tagged with the kind of change, e.g. *fixed*, *added*, *removed*, or *deprecated*.


## License

$project has been released under the MIT Open Source license.
